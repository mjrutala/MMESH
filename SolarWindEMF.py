How I imagine this framework to work:
    
    The SolarWindEM class is loaded with spacecraft data and corresponding models
        (The input data is assumed to be trimmed appropriately, i.e. only solar wind data)
    The model then iterates over each spacecraft and model combination:
        First, baselining the input relationship
        Then, applying Dynamic Time Warping to the model timeseries and comparing it to the spacecraft
        Then, optionally display how the delta t changes with time, other statistics, etc.
        ...
        Finally, store the shifted and/or warped model outputs
    Average over the model outputs
        Have option for simple average, or weighting based on some factor
        (Primarily simple average, as this seems to be an agreed upon standard in EM)
        
        Finally, store the ensemble model outputs (after averaging) in a top level dataframe
        Additionally, save the times at which the EM is available (i.e., times when all models are present)
